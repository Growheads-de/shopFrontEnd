# Google OAuth Testing Guide

## What Has Been Fixed

1. **Fixed the `require` Error in config.js**
   - Updated the configuration loading approach to use localStorage instead of require

2. **Fixed the Invalid Hook Call Error**
   - Created a proper functional component wrapper for GoogleOAuthProvider
   - Made sure React hooks are only used within function components

3. **Added Google OAuth Testing Components**
   - Created a GoogleAuthTest component to test different OAuth approaches
   - Added navigation to the Auth Test page from both desktop and mobile menus

## How to Test

1. **Visit the Auth Test Page**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/auth-test in your browser
   - Or click on the "Auth Test" link in the navigation menu

2. **Test Both Login Methods**
   - Try the standard Google login button
   - Try the custom Google login button

3. **Debug Information**
   - Check the browser console for login responses
   - Alert dialogs will also display when login succeeds or fails

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter errors:

1. **Check Google Client ID**
   - Verify your Google OAuth Client ID in src/index.js is correct
   - Make sure the Google Cloud Console project has the right settings

2. **Authorized Domains**
   - Ensure http://localhost:3000 is added as an authorized JavaScript origin
   - Ensure http://localhost:3000 is added as an authorized redirect URI

3. **React Version Compatibility**
   - This implementation should work with React 19 and the latest @react-oauth/google package

4. **Network Issues**
   - Check browser network tab for any requests to Google APIs failing
   - Ensure no CORS errors are occurring

## Test Flow

1. User clicks the Google Sign-In button
2. Google authentication popup appears
3. User selects their Google account
4. User agrees to the permissions
5. Popup closes and the application receives authentication information
6. Check console/alerts for login success
